Each student will also be expected to complete one substantial research paper on a topic of their choosing. These papers may take one of two forms. They can either be based on an original reading of primary materials, or they may be a well-developed historiographical essay which reviews the literature on a particular topic in depth. In either case, these papers should be on the order of 15-20 pages - and absolutely no longer than 25. Preliminary bibliographies will be due by session 7, and a five page presentation of the major issues in the literature is due on session 10. The final draft of the paper is due 3 days after session 13 and this draft may incorporate wholly the text written for the April assignment. Students may choose to submit a draft of their papers at least a week and a half in advance and I will be happy to comment on them.
